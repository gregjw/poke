Poke is a component library specifically for buttons, **built on top of [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components).** 

**Brought to you by [Feather](https://feather-cfm.com) and our design community, [Human Friendly](https://uiux.blog).**

  ## What's Poke?
Poke's aim is to provide designers & front-end developers with an easy-to-use button toolkit.  
  
The ramp for front-end basics is getting shorter to shorter and the team at [Feather](https://feather-cfm.com) thought that an incredibly specific component library would be pretty useful for developers, in the age of [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) and [Foundation](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites), where the majority of developers are used to having a highly-usable tool at their fingertips within seconds.

We want to emphasise that Poke is an evolving codebase & completely open design project, please feel free to submit a pull request and contribute your own button sets.
